I was able to try on a multi-GPU today and there is indeed a strong difference.\\nWe got about the same results that you get: F1 of VERSION and exact match of VERSION .\\nI am investigating that right now, my personal guess is that this may be related to things outside the model it-self like the optimizer or the post-processing in SQuAD as these were not compared between the TF and PT models.\\nI will keep you guys updated in this issue and I add a mention in the readme that the SQuAD example doesn't work yet.\\nIf you have some insights, feel free to participate in the discussion.\"},\n",

And run_classifer.py was ok apart from the sub-optimal additional weights initialization.\\nI will merge the develop branch as soon as we got the final results confirmed (currently it's been training for 20 minutes ( VERSION epoch) on 4GPU with a batch size of 56 and we are already above 85 on F1 on SQuAD and 77 in exact match so I'm rather confident and I think you guys can play with it too now).\\nI am also cleaning up the code base to prepare for a first release that we will put on pip for easier access.\"},\n",

I guess more tuning will increase the score some more.\\nThe best configuration for me so far is:\\n\\nBatch size: 160 (on four P40 GPUs with 24GB RAM each). Smaller batch sizes that fit on one or two GPUs give bad results.\\nOptimizer: Adam with learning rate 1e-4. Tried BertAdam with learning rate 1e-5, but it didn't seem to converge.\\n FILEPATH : Only fp32 works. Tried fp16 (half precision) to allow larger batch sizes, but this gave really low scores, with and without loss scaling.\\n\\nAlso, properly averaging the loss is important: Not just loss /= batch_size. You need to take into account padding and word pieces without predictions ( FILEPATH #33 (comment)). If you have a mask tensor that indicates which bert inputs correspond to tagged tokens, then the proper averaging is loss /= mask.float().sum\\nAnother tip, truncating the input (#66) enables much larger batch sizes.

       "  'text': \"Hi all,\\nI am trying to train the BERT model on some data that I have. However, I am having trouble understanding how to adjust the labels following tokenization. I am trying to perform word level classification (similar to NER)\\nIf I have the following tokenized sentence and its' labels:\\noriginal_tokens = ['The', ', 'eng-30- COMMIT FLAG ', ' ', 'frailty']\\noriginal_labels = [0, 2, 3, 4, 1]\\n\\nThen after using the BERT tokenizer I get the following:\\nbert_tokens = ['[CLS]', 'the', ' ', 'eng-30- COMMIT FLAG ', ' ', 'frail', '##ty', '[SEP]']\\nAlso, I adjust my label array as follows:\\nbert_labels = [0, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1]\\nN.B. Tokens such as eng-30- COMMIT FLAG are not tokenized further as I included an ignore list which contains words and tokens that I do not want tokenized and I swapped them with the [unusedXXX] tokens found in the vocab.txt file.\\nNotice how the last word 'frailty' is transformed into ['frail', '##ty'] and the label '1' which was used for the whole word is now placed under each word piece. Is this the correct way of doing it? If you would like a more in-depth explanation of what I am trying to achieve you can read the following: URL \\nAny help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance\"},\n",

You can use the following code in order to check if any layer has been modified (it should work for any pytorch code if I am not wrong, not just BERT):\\nimport copy\\nfrom transformers import BertModel\\n\\nbert = BertModel.from_pretrained(\\'bert-base-uncased\\')\\nlayer = bert.embeddings\\nfrozen_parameters = {}\\n\\n# Copy tensors\\nfor name, p in layer.named_parameters():\\n frozen_parameters[name] = copy.deepcopy(p.data) # Freeze in order to be able to compare later\\n\\n# Do stuff ...\\n\\n# Check if the value of the tensors have been updated\\nfor name, p in layer.named_parameters():\\n updated = (frozen_parameters[name] != p.data).any().cpu().detach().numpy()\\n\\n print(f\"Layer \\'{name}\\' has been updated? {\\'yes\\' if updated else \\'no\\'}\")\\nIt is very similar to the code I use in order to check if a layer has been updated (remember that it won\\'t be updated if grad_fn is None), but I have not tested this exactly code.\\nI hope it helps!'},\n",

On construction, each of these classes takes a config argument, where config is a BertConfig object (also defined in modeling.py). The BertConfig can either be created from a model at one of the links in PRETRAINED_MODEL_ARCHIVE_MAP or from a config file stored in a local directory. You just have to set the pretrained_model_name to a local directory containing a bert_config.json file and a pytorch_model.bin file rather than one of \\'bert-base-uncased\\', \\'bert-large-uncased\\' etc. Setting pretrained_model_name to one of the latter options will try to pull from the Amazon AWS repositories. So if you\\'re running the run_classification.py script, you would set the \\'bert-model\\' flag to the directory with your downloaded bert model if you don\\'t want it to pull from AWS. One thing is if you\\'ve downloaded one of the original Google Bert models, you\\'ll need to convert tf checkpoints to pytorch bin files. There\\'s a script for this in the repository.

In this case, the fi- nal hidden vectors corresponding to the mask tokens are\\n fed into an output softmax over the vo- cabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our exper- iments, we \\nmask 15% of all WordPiece tokens in each sequence at random. In contrast to denoising auto-encoders \\n(Vincent et al., 2008), we only pre- dict the masked words rather than reconstructing the entire input. \\n\\nSo as far as I can see:\\n\\n FILEPATH (afaik the masking scheme here is correct) and make the model correct our \"mistakes\". It only makes sense - we break the input, and the model corrects it;\\n\\nBut if you look here, here and here - it seems to me that in the code:\\n\\n FILEPATH ;\\nThe lm targets are the \"messed up\" tokens;\\n\\nSo, the training is kind of reversed.\\nThe correct sequence is passed, but the incorrect sequence is the target.\\nAnyway - I may just have missed some line of code, that changes everything.\\nI am just trying to understand the model properly, because I need to do a total rewrite of the pre-processing, because in my domain usage of embedding bags proved to be more beneficial than BPE.\\nMany thanks!'},\n",

But this week when I ran the exact same code which had compiled and run earlier, it threw an error when executing this statement:\\ninput_ids = pad_sequences([tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(txt) for txt in tokenized_texts], maxlen=MAX_LEN, dtype=”long”, truncating=”post”, padding=”post”)\\n\\nValueError: Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified\\nmaximum sequence length for this BERT model (632 > 512).

To summarise, it looks for the answer to a question from a collection of documents -- all these documents most likely contain different kinds of information regarding a particular topic. For example, a system built using cdQA could contain 10 different documents regarding 10 different historical periods, and you could ask it a question about any of these time periods, and it would search for the relevant answer within these 10 documents.\\nHowever, if the system you want to build is such: you have 10 court orders, and you want to ask the system the same set of questions for each court order. For example:\\n\\nWhen was the order filed?\\nWho filed the order?\\nWho was the order filed against?\\nWas there a settlement?\\n\\nIn this case, I wouldn't want the system to search through every document, but instead look for answers within the document itself. Exactly like SQuaD VERSION .\\nMy assessment is that I wouldn't be able to build such a system using cdQA but I could use the cdQA annotator to build my dataset. Is that a sound assessment?\\nAlso, I'm curious to hear your thoughts on how feasible it would be to expect good results when the context is rather long (anywhere between 2-10 pages).\\nThank you :)\"},\n",

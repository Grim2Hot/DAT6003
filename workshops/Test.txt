At a high level, every Spark application consists of a driver program that runs the user’s main function and executes various parallel operations on a cluster. The main abstraction Spark provides is a resilient distributed dataset (RDD), which is a collection of elements partitioned across the nodes of the cluster that can be operated on in parallel. RDDs are created by starting with a file in the Hadoop file system (or any other Hadoop-supported file system), or an existing Scala collection in the driver program, and transforming it. Users may also ask Spark to persist an RDD in memory, allowing it to be reused efficiently across parallel operations. Finally, RDDs automatically recover from node failures.

A second abstraction in Spark is shared variables that can be used in parallel operations. By default, when Spark runs a function in parallel as a set of tasks on different nodes, it ships a copy of each variable used in the function to each task. Sometimes, a variable needs to be shared across tasks, or between tasks and the driver program. Spark supports two types of shared variables: broadcast variables, which can be used to cache a value in memory on all nodes, and accumulators, which are variables that are only “added” to, such as counters and sums.

This guide shows each of these features in each of Spark’s supported languages. It is easiest to follow along with if you launch Spark’s interactive shell – either bin/spark-shell for the Scala shell or bin/pyspark for the Python one.

RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset) is a fundamental data structure of Spark and it is the primary data abstraction in Apache Spark and the Spark Core. RDDs are fault-tolerant, immutable distributed collections of objects, which means once you create an RDD you cannot change it. Each dataset in RDD is divided into logical partitions, which can be computed on different nodes of the cluster.

In other words, RDDs are a collection of objects similar to collections in Scala, with the difference being RDD is computed on several JVMs scattered across multiple physical servers also called nodes in a cluster while a Scala collection lives on a single JVM.
